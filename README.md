### **Summary of Findings**

Our project shed light on the important variables in predicting recidivism. Although the accuracy of none of models were impressively high, the closer analysis of the significant variables can be useful to promote higher rates of desistance. We went into the project with the ambition of describing potential programs or areas worth investing man power or capital in to lower rates of recidivism. We came away with the prominent findings that employment, drug use, and geographic location are among the most significant variables in predicting recidivism. Rather than use a predictive model such as the one we created to closely monitor individuals with higher chances of recidivism, states and counties ought to consider the key variables we found when predicting recidivism in order to promote desistance. For employment, perhaps individuals newly-released from prison should receive some sort of capital or social job opportunity. For drug use, individuals should be placed in rehab programs and supported in their battle with drugs. Considering the incarceration system holistically, we found distinctions between white and black prisoners. Racial equality will continue to remain an important ambition of states and societies, and that especially applies to prisons. For geographic location, perhaps the state can work toward equality of opportunity across communities. Working with, rather than against, newly-released prisoners can facilitate a positive feedback loop. Promoting the good rather than preparing for the bad is the solution to lower recidivism rates.
